  <h4>Emotion-Aware Spotify Playlist Generator</h4>
  
  <p>I created an end-to-end, emotion-aware music-recommendation platform that begins with natural-language understanding and finishes with a curated Spotify playlist. Users start on a simple Flask web page where they can "vent" about how they feel. The application splits that free-form text into sentences, then feeds each fragment into a Naive Bayes emotion classifier.</p>
  
  <p>The model outputs a list of emotions and their associated confidence levels. From there, the app queries Spotify's API to find songs that match the detected emotional profile, creating a personalized playlist that resonates with the user's current mood.</p>
  
  <p>This project combines natural language processing, machine learning, and music information retrieval to create a unique user experience that transforms emotions into curated music selections.</p>
